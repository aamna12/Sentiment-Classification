<b>Sentiment Classification using BERT</b>
<br>
BERT is a powerful technique for natural language processing that can improve how well computers comprehend human language. The foundation of BERT is the idea of exploiting bidirectional context to acquire complex and insightful word and phrase representations. By simultaneously examining both sides of a word’s context, BERT can capture a word’s whole meaning in its context, in contrast to earlier models that only considered the left or right context of a word. This enables BERT to deal with ambiguous and complex linguistic phenomena including polysemy, co-reference, and long-distance relationships.

<h3>BERT Tokenization</h3>
BERT tokenization is used to convert the raw text into numerical inputs that can be fed into the BERT model. It tokenized the text and performs some preprocessing to prepare the text for the model’s input format. <br><br>
BERT has achieved great accuracy and performance on the sentiment classification test, as well as the ability to handle complex and varied linguistic expressions.
